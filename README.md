# FriendFinder
In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

Users will enter their name and a picture if they would like, answer the survey and pair them to their new friend!

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Body_Parser, Path, Express and Bootstrap.

Object of this assignment is to have your "back end" talking to your "front end". You have the user fill out the questionnaire and send that data to your back end, and have the back end compare the users information with the other users information and return the "friend" match to the screen.
