# FriendFinder
I struggled the most on the array part, took me awhile to figure out how to "compare" the user results to my friends list results.
I feel I did something wrong there because sometimes it pushes the users scores into a temperary array if you will, when you finsihed the questions and submit, your name you put in would show up with no picture, not sure what thats about. Also getting the back end to display the correct information to the front end was hard, seemed like requesting was much easier than posting for some reason. I defintely need to study more on this.
